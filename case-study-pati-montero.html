        <title>Case study: My own website | Pati Montero | UX designer</title>
        <meta name="description" content="In 2016, I launched a one-page website that had many problems. To name a few, it had poor traffic and almost none returning visitors. But the worst fact was that nine out of ten people abandoned it within a few seconds. Two years later, I decided it was time for a remake. But, to do a fair job, I needed to identify all the problems I could. I thought design thinking could help. Thus, I started this journey.">

                <h1>Case study: My own website</h1>
                <p class="intro">In 2016, I launched a <a href="http://patriciamontero.github.io/index-en.html">one-page website</a> that had many problems. To name a few, it had poor traffic and almost none returning visitors. The last straw was that eight out of ten people left it within a few seconds. I decided to redesign the whole thing. Although to do a fair job, I needed to identify all the problems I could. I thought UX design could help... And it did!</p>
                <p>The purpose of this page is to register the path that took me from a flawed website to a user-centred one. Below is the summed content of my process, based on <a href="#research">research</a>, <a href="#strategy">strategy</a> and <a href="#design">design</a>.</p>
                <p>Should you need more details, please click the buttons to unfold each step. Plus, the text links will take you to the source of every related bit of information.</p>
                <h3><a id="research"></a>Research</h3>
                <p>Somehow, I knew that my website had problems. At first, I thought I was aware of everything. But, after a week of researching, I learned that I didn't know the half of it. Yikes!</p>
                <p>An analysis of data gave me some facts: poor traffic, low engagement and an enormous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate">bounce rate</a>. I had a few explanations for all this. Although, I didn't learn the actual reasons until I performed a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/user-testing-jakob-nielsen/?lm=how-many-test-users&pt=article">usability test</a>.</p>
                <p>This test consisted of five people using my website by my side. That allowed me to see the actual issues or <em>pain points</em>. A hidden portfolio made it useless. A non-standard menu frustrated the testers. They agreed on the fact that I should clarify my services and availability. Man, I had no idea how confusing my website was.</p>

                <button class="accordion">What was happening</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <h3>Quantitative user data</h3>
                    <p>From January to May 2018, I followed the performance of my website in <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none">Google Analytics</a>. I centred my analysis on the audience, acquisition and behaviour. These were the main issues observed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>Low traffic and lack of engagement</strong>. There were 83 sessions completed by 58 people. Only nine of them returned during those five months.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Huge bounce rate</strong>. 83% of the users left after visiting a single page. The average session lasted 46 seconds.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Weak referencing</strong>. Most of the people who visited the website arrived by tapping its URL address. Only nine came from social media and seven by organic search.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why was that? Some hypotheses I had</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>Misuse of a resource and lack of originality</strong>. I used a template. Although it was a nice one, it didn't expose my abilities as a web designer. The icing on the cake was that I forced it into showing a whole case study within a popup window.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Need for focus</strong>. My goal was to attract clients as a graphic designer, photographer and illustrator. That was <a href="https://seanwes.com/podcast/194-doing-too-many-things-at-once-heres-what-to-do-instead/">too many things</a> to offer at once. I should have narrowed my services.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Impossible to measure or share</strong>. As the portfolio items opened in a popup window, there was no way to register the traffic towards a project. I couldn't measure which content was more interesting. Nobody was able to share a specific work with anyone.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Dated content</strong>. Since I released it, I forgot about it. I didn't take the time to keep the portfolio up to date.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You'd think that at this moment I've had all the reasons why my website was failing. But, to my surprise, I haven't seen anything yet. Not until I watched real people struggling with it.</p>
                    <img class="project" src="images/pati-montero-old-website.jpg" alt="Pati Montero's old website">
                    <p class="legend">My old website. When users clicked on an item from the portfolio, it opened as a popup window.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Why was it happening</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <h3>Qualitative user data</h3>
                    <p>Within a week, I scheduled a usability test with five co-workers. 45 minutes at lunchtime, one at a time. Their profiles didn't match my target audience as they should. Still, observing them while exploring the website opened my eyes in an unforeseen way.</p>
                    <img class="project" src="images/pati-montero-uxmap.jpg" alt="Experience map">
                    <p class="legend">My first experience map. A weird mix of Spanglish and Franpagnol.</p>
                    <p>I registered all my notes in an experience map. For this, I followed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ux-design-2-analyzing-user-data/develop-metrics">Chris Nodder's instructions</a>. It was a tangle of languages, mixing English, French and Spanish, but it worked. It allowed me to visualize at once the observations I gathered during the usability test.</p>
                    <p>As I was working alone, I craved for a team, so I looked for help. My husband and our son assisted me through the process. Even if they didn't observe the users, the notes came in handy. Together, we identified the hardest tasks for the users: the pain points.</p>
                    <a id="painpoints"></a><h4>The paint points</h4>
                    <p>These are the main issues revealed by the testers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>The portfolio items looked flat</strong>. A few users ignored that the thumbnails were clickable and so they didn't explore them. To me, this is the most severe problem. An invisible portfolio makes the whole website of a creative person meaningless.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Non-standard menu labels</strong>. Phrases like "What I do" instead of "Portfolio" puzzled the users.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Purposelessness</strong>. All testers criticized the lacking of an explicit call-to-action.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Content set under the fold</strong>. On the main page, a large photograph pushed the information downwards and out of the screen. On the portfolio pieces, a couple of people ignored that there was more content below.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Weak flow</strong>. Some users had troubles finding their way back to the home page from the portfolio windows. It was also hard to differentiate the visited sections from the ones they haven't seen yet.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3><a id="strategy"></a>Strategy</h3>
                <p>Once I finished the research, I began to set my goals. I outlined them in two directions: for the users and the business. The first ones aimed at the improvement of the user's experience. The other ones, to secure my success as an entrepreneur.</p>
                <p>Next, I decided to narrow my practice and choose an audience. As this is my first exposure to UX design, I needed to simplify all I could to learn faster and stay motivated. </p>
                <p>My audience would be creative men and women, like photographers, illustrators and artists. People whose websites would revolve around a portfolio. I could work for them as a part of a team or as a consultant. So, I defined the profile of two primary personas: a potential boss and a client. They would keep me focused along the way. Also, I will measure these goals three months after the launching.</p>
                <p>Thanks to these steps I underwent the best creative process I've had as a professional. I only had to look for solutions to the identified problems, always keeping my personas in mind. Then, I would picture them interacting with those solutions.</p>
                <img class="project" src="images/pati-montero-strategy.jpg" alt="Strategy for my new wbesite">
                    <p class="legend">From left to right: sketches, scenarios, storyboards and paper prototype.</p>
                <button class="accordion">Goals</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <h3>Establishing goals for the user and the business</h3>
                    <p>The pain points revealed in the research period gave me the goals for my website's redesign. Inspired by <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/">Jake Knapp</a>, I turned them into <em>how may we</em> questions. I found this approach very enlightening. Each idea, every single sketch would answer one or some of the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>How may we make the portfolio items seem clickable?</span></li>
                        <li><span>How may we display easy-to-understand menu labels?</span></li>
                        <li><span>How may we deliver a website with a clear mission?</span></li>
                        <li><span>How may we reveal the whole content in the portfolio section?</span></li>
                        <li><span>How may we provide a seamless browsing experience?</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So far, so good, right? Not quite. While these questionings acknowledged the pain points, they neglected my own goals. And this is also important for design thinking. After all, as Jeff Gothelf says, <a href="https://www.jeffgothelf.com/books/#zona-03">it offers solutions for the client that also benefit the business</a>.</p>
                    <p>My goals as an entrepreneur arose from the three main issues I observed in Google Analytics. I will check them within three months after the launching of the new website:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>Double the traffic and increase the engagement by 40%</strong>. At least 116 people should come to the new website, of which 15 or more would be returning users.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Reduce the bounce rate to 60% or less</strong>. No more than six out of 10 people should leave the site without visiting other pages. If the average session lasts more than one minute, I'll throw a party!</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Improve the referencing</strong>. Most of the traffic should come from social media or external links.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By this moment, I was well aware of the problems I had to solve and why. Next, I needed to know for whom &mdash;besides myself&mdash; I was going to do it all.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Audience</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <h3>Defining the target audience (Personas)</h3>
                    <p>When I decided to narrow my practice, everything started to make sense. I knew that I wanted to serve creative people and this simplified my learning journey on UX. I then chose to address my work towards two primary personas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>A potential boss</strong>, who would push me to develop my process and explain it.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>A potential client</strong>, who would drive me to understand my audience and their needs.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then, a secondary persona came to mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>A student</strong>, who would remind me to keep my message clear, relevant and simple.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="legend">Generating ideas while commuting by train. Here, I was looking at a general view of the interface (desktop and mobile) and a possible sitemap.</p>
                    <p>Before I started a creative process based on UX design, I sketched for the web without purpose. I put ideas on paper almost without any sense or meaning. In fact, <a href="https://jpattonassociates.com/design-studio-recipe/">instead of generating lots of ideas</a>, I iterated the same though once and again.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, I even stopped after the first idea. In this case, it was the one below. I wanted to create a whole website by using a single colour. It would be pink for English, blue for French and green for Spanish. The main menu would descend while the user scrolls down.</p>
                    <img class="project" src="images/pm-ux-ideation-03.jpg" alt="My first idea for this website">
                    <p class="legend">My first idea for this project was a monochromatic website.</p>
                    <p>I drafted this idea before starting the usability test. By then, I knew that I wanted a standard menu. Although, I still didn't know how hard having two buttons for three languages was for the users.</p>
                    <p>My process took a big leap forward when I translated the pain points into how may we questions. Up until then, my previous thoughts were often about a general view of the future interface. Later on, I started to devote a whole ideation session to one issue in particular. It was easier to tackle one problem at a time. I felt much more inventive and focused.</p>

                    <p>For several days, I drew different ideas until I got satisfying answers to all the pain points. It all boiled down to two alternatives. One with the main menu on top and the other one, to the left. I then consulted my husband, who is an experienced web developer. We agreed that the most efficient one would be the latter. In my case, it allowed having more content without making it all look busy.</p>

                    <p class="legend">A glimpse into one of my scenarios (back) and storyboards (front).</p>
                    <p>After the ideation phase, I was too eager to build my prototype. I wanted to skip the making of scenarios and storyboards. But I'm glad I didn't. They helped to visualize √âlise, Normand and Noelia interacting with my website. This revealed stuff I wouldn't have considered otherwise.</p>
                    <h4>The imaginary journeys of my personas</h4>
                    <p><strong>√âlise</strong> stumbled upon the <em>About</em> page through a Google search on a desktop computer. She was looking for a UX designer located in Montreal. First, she scanned the content relevant to her and downloaded my resume. Then, she moved onto the project pages. Finally, she had the human resources team to contact me by phone with the information provided on my cv.</p>
                    <p><strong>Normand</strong> arrived at the homepage by typing my URL address on a tablet. One of his friends had recommended me to him as he wanted to redesign his website. He clicked on the featured project and scanned the process. Normand found the content related to his interest. Therefore, he decided to email me.</p>
                    <p><strong>Noelia</strong> came to a project in progress through social media. She was using her cell phone. She scanned the content and followed some external links. Noelia found this useful and resolved to follow me on Twitter. In this way, she'd keep track of my website to reach other relevant resources.</p>
                    <p>These hypothetical visits drove me to consider several factors throughout the design phase:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>The user's profile</strong>: sex, age, education, goals and interests.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>The device</strong>: desktop or mobile.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>The source of traffic</strong>: direct, organic search or referenced by other sites.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>The flow</strong>: from the initial page to the desired action.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                <p>By the time I got to build the paper prototype, I was overexcited. I did make one for the home page. It was pretty basic, but it helped me to play loosely with all the elements of the interface. Next, I needed to see it for real. So, I started drafting a wireframe, then a simple mock-up and before I knew it, I started coding it.</p>
                <p>Because my website's structure is rather conventional, I skipped the prototype's usability test. Instead, I decided to follow standard web design practices and validate it once finished.</p>
                <img class="project" src="images/pm-workspace.jpg" alt="My workspace">
                <p class="legend">Since I'm not planning to keep a blog and as I'm learning to code, my website is quite simple. There's no CMS for now.</p>

                  <h3>The rudimentary stages of the user interface (UI)</h3>
                  <p>At this point, I couldn't wait to jump into the design of the user interface. I made a paper prototype and, despite its simplicity, it helped me to play loosely with all its elements.</p>

Still, for this same reason and because my website is rather simple, I skipped the usability test he suggests for a paper prototype.</p>

                  <p>I wireframed a sort of one-page concept for the homepage. It would contain three parts: intro, portfolio and contact. The first one would take to the about section. The second would showcase three items, and each of them would lead to an extra page.</p>

                  <p>Next, I felt ready to draft a simple mockup. I wanted to create an elegant and uncomplicated concept:</p>

                      <li><span>Because of the lack of contrast, I had to let go of the idea of a single colour for the entire website. I may try it again someday.</span></li>
                      <li><span>Instead, I conceived a layout with web safe fonts and the default colours for texts and links. I was trying to build a refined composition with essential tools.</span></li>
                      <li><span>I also strived to <a href="http://erikdkennedy.com/#writing">design with plenty of white space</a>. It helps in delivering a more pleasant look.</span></li>
                      <li><span>Finally, I added an explicit link to the About page. After another review of the scenarios and storyboards, I felt the need for it.</span></li>

                  <blockquote class="panel">&ldquo;The key is to review the typeface in context. This means with the actual content and on a website. Website, in this case, meaning actual HTML and CSS in a browser, not an approximation in a graphic design tool.&rdquo;

                  <p>I wanted to check in the browsers if this pairing of <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/verdana">Verdana</a> and <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/georgia">Georgia</a> could work out for my content. And so, I leaped into coding, ignoring that I'd end up building a whole responsive website from scratch. Which, at that time, was one of my wildest dreams. Even after having taken some valid courses like <a href="https://internetingishard.com/">this one</a>. I kid you not.</p>

                  <h3>Choosing and pairing typefaces</h3>
                  <p>Since I started coding, I understood what <a href="https://matejlatin.co.uk/books/2017/07/31/better-web-typography-for-a-better-web/">Matej Latin</a> meant. A design tool can't always show how your content will render on browsers. Once I saw my texts with that pairing of Verdana and Georgia, I thought it all looked plain. </p>
                  <p>I do like Georgia, though. It's such a beautiful typeface. I know that it'll work fine, even with my longer texts, because it's pretty easy to read on screen.</p>
                  <img class="project" src="images/pati-montero-process-01.png" alt="Georgia and Impact pairing">
                  <p class="legend">Impact on the titles and Georgia on the paragraphs.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda">Instead of pure black</a>, I used a dark grey for all content. The active links were blue and the visited ones, purple. I aimed to make a layout work out of the default settings.</p>
                  <p>The problem then was in the titles. I tried <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/impact">Impact</a>, but later I found the contrast too overwhelming. Since I still wanted to stick to web safe fonts, I tested Georgia for the titles as well.</p>
                  <p>The use of colour was bothering me, so I shifted to a white and dark-grey layout.</p>
                  <img class="project" src="images/pati-montero-process-02.png" alt="Georgia on everything">
                  <p class="legend">Georgia bold on the titles and regular on the paragraphs.</p>
                  <p>Although I liked the result, I desired a mightier contrast. I found it with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a>. It's not a web safe font, but as I'm only calling it as regular and bold from Google Fonts, the size of my website will stay low.</p>
                  <p>In short, I'll use two typefaces: a sans-serif for the titles and a serif for the paragraphs.</p>

                  <h3>Setting a responsive modular scale</h3>
                  <p>Nerdy as I am, I wanted to establish a modular scale for my responsive website. I tried various approaches that I didn't get until I found <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/responsive-modular-scale/">Zell Liew</a>'s proposal. Based on <a href="https://www.modularscale.com/">this tool</a>, I chose a different scale ratio for each breakpoint. The smaller the screen, the closest the ratio:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><span>Phone &mdash; 15:16</span></li>
                      <li><span>Tablet &mdash; 8:9</span></li>
                      <li><span>Desktop &mdash; 5:6</span></li>
                      <li><span>Big screen &mdash; 4:6</span></li>
                  </ul>
                  <blockquote class="panel">&ldquo;This method works because a smaller ratio produces a scale with smaller differences between font-sizes at each step. It gives us more sizes that are acceptable on a mobile device. &rdquo;

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>What I like the most about this strategy is that it considers the way we perceive texts in context. When we read on a small screen, there isn't much we can do besides scrolling up and down. That means that titles don't need to be much larger than paragraphs to grab our attention. On big screens though, there are plenty of things that distract us from the content, so titles need to stand out.</p>

                  <h3>Setting the menu and colour scheme</h3>
                  <p>When I was happy with my typefaces, I started developing the menus and colour scheme. At first, I separated the languages from the main navigation menu. Then, I added a few images and a simple greyscale layout.</p>
                  <img class="project" src="images/pati-montero-process-04.png" alt="Main menu to the left and languages were on a top bar">
                  <p class="legend">The main menu was to the left while the languages were on a top bar.</p>
                  <p>Next, I created a colour scheme out of my corporate tone (#fa7057). By following <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/">Laura Elizabeth's tutorial</a>, I chose these shades:</p>
                  <div class="palette">
                      <div id="color1">#fa7057 &mdash; Main accent</div>
                      <div id="color2">#fcb7ab &mdash; Secondary accent</div>
                      <div id="color3">#454241 &mdash; Darkest shade</div>
                      <div id="color4">#faf3f2 &mdash; Lightest shade</div>
                      <div id="color5"> White</div>
                  </div>
                  <img class="project" src="images/pati-montero-process-05.png" alt="Main menu to the left and languages were on top">
                  <p class="legend">The darkest shade is for the texts; the accents, for links and buttons. The softer tones are for the backgrounds.</p>
                  <p>Finally, I joined both menus and added the social media icons. All by keeping them in three differentiated areas, so I could: </p>
                  <ul>

                      <li><span><strong>Reduce the options that could overwhelm the users</strong>. By using an ivy leaf or icons instead of text, users would distinguish these sections as groups  &mdash; <a href="https://lawsofux.com/law-of-common-region.html">Law of common region</a>.</span></li>
                      <li><span><strong>Make the menu easier to digest</strong>. Without the separation, it'd had ten items, which is more than what people can keep in their working memory &mdash; <a href="https://lawsofux.com/millers-law.html">Miller's law</a>.</span></li>

                    <h4>Content</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li><span><strong>Good readability</strong>. Overall, <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">the readable level is five</a>. I've avoided the use of passive voice, adverbs and jargon without explanation.</span></li>
                      <li><span><strong>Scannable text</strong>. Short phrases, short paragraphs. One idea at a time and the first one is often a summary. Titles give a fair idea of the content.</span></li>
                      <li><span><strong>Regular text sizing</strong>. Characters' size is at least 16 pixels, and it adapts to the viewport.</span></li>
                      <li><span><strong>Lightness</strong>. I optimized all images to reduce the time required to download the website. Also, I disregarded content management systems to keep a cleaner code.</span></li>
                      <li><span><strong>Available further content</strong>. I'm aware that this case study is longer than the wintertime in Canada. For this reason, I hid and labelled the details in an accordion. If most users ignore them, it's not a concern as the main content sums it all. That eases scrolling down while allowing others to get more details if needed.</span></li>
                      <li><span><strong>Reliability</strong>. There are some quotes and hyperlinks to the sources. I incorporated them not only to back my ideas but to acknowledge the wise people that have taught me so much.</span></li>
                      <li><span><strong>Limited use of instructions</strong>. I tried to make all the content self-explanatory. Still, I added some guidance to help the users in a few introductory texts.</span></li>
                    </ul>

Her kind reply didn't take long. She's one of my favourite illustrators, so I am thrilled that she let me revamp her website.</p>
