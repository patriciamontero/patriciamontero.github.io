                    <p class="intro">To craft web things that are accessible, user-centred and pretty.</p>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Patricia C. Montero. I'm a Venezuelan web designer based in Montreal, and <em>this</em> is my design system.</p>
                    <img src="images/moms-flowers.png" alt="A woman, smiling, surrounded by flowers">
                    <p>This design system is a work in progress. To me, it's a learning tool as well as a way to define my brand. It covers three sections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="accent"> <a href="index.html">Brand foundations</a></span>. On the strategy behind my creative work.</li>
                        <li><span class="accent"> <a href="styles.html">Style guide and assets</a></span>. About my logo, typography, colour palette and other related matters.</li>
                        <li><span class="accent"> <a href="code.html">Components and code</a>.</span> On the different pieces used to communicate and the way of handling them.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why do I need a design system?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="accent">To learn</span>. The best way to understand something is to do it by myself.</li>
                        <li><span class="accent">To remember</span>. I'm prone to neglect some of the reasoning behind my design process.</li>
                        <li class="last"><span class="accent">To optimize</span>. It'll be a reference for all my design work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="principles" class="xtarget">Principles <span class="anchor">#</span></h2>
                    <p class="intro">These are the notions that guide my professional ventures. I adopted them to keep my image consistent and close to myself.</p>
                    <h3>Openness</h3>
                    <p>I've recently embraced accessibility, and it soon became one of my core beliefs as a designer. I hope that everyone feels welcome around my work regardless of their abilities.</p>
                    <h3>Curiosity</h3>
                    <p>Always learning, I stay motivated towards a new idea or project. I intend to keep pace with the endless evolution of web design.</p>
                    <h3>Happiness</h3>
                    <p>I cherish the life I have, and I try to express that in my work.</p>
                    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
                    <p>I tend to over-complicate things, yet I always end up seeing that simpler is better.</p>
                    <h2 id="audience" class="xtarget">Audience <span class="anchor">#</span></h2>
                    <p class="intro">Although this design system is open to anyone, I'm building it having creative people in mind. It may be useful for web designers, developers and user experience designers.</p>
                    <p>To keep this exercise focused, I created these personas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="accent"><a href="#elise">A boss</a></span>, who would drive me to develop and explain my process.</li>
                        <li><span class="accent"><a href="#norman">A client</a></span>, to help me understand my audience and their needs.</li>
                        <li><span class="accent"><a href="#sarah">A coworker</a></span>, to remind me that I'm not the only user of the system.</li>
                    </ul>
